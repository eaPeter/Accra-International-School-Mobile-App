## Hello world!âœ¨

<p>
Check out my #UI design for an educational app I started developing. I named it the Accra International School Mobile App.
 
This app comes with some not very usual features. Instructors can post courses they created themselves and can also recommend courses even from other educational apps. 
 
Students can also get access to courses posted by instructors, be it recommended courses or courses owned by the instructors. 
 
There are features to make the user manage deadlines and assignments to prevent deadlines from escaping them. The app also has a Downloads page that makes course resources available to students offline.
 
The app has been built with react native. Codes to the app can be found at #github using this link: https://lnkd.in/dMssbXFT
